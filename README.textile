h1. Configliere

Configliere provides discreet configuration for ruby scripts.

bq. So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows. -- Don Corleone

You've got a script. It's got some settings. Some settings are for this module, some are for that module. Most of them don't change. Except on your laptop, where the paths are different.  Or when you're in production mode. Or when you're testing from the command line.

Configliere manages settings from many sources: static constants, simple config files, environment variables, commandline options, straight ruby. You don't have to predefine anything, but you can ask configliere to type-convert, require, document or password-obscure any of its fields. Modules can define config settings independently of each other and the main program.

h3. Example

Here's a simple example, using params from a config file and the command line. In the script:

<pre>
    #/usr/bin/env ruby
    require 'configliere'
    Settings.use :commandline, :config_file

    Settings({
      :dest_time => '11-05-1955',
      :delorean => {
        :power_source => 'plutonium',
        :roads_needed => true,
        },
      :username => 'marty',
    })
    Settings.define :dest_time, :type => DateTime, :description => "Date to travel to"
    Settings.read './examples/simple_script.yaml'
    Settings.resolve!
    p Settings</pre>

We'll override some of the defaults with a config file, in this case ./examples/simple_script.yaml

<pre>
    # Settings for return
    :dest_time:       11-05-1985
    :delorean:    
      :power_source:  1.21 jiggawatts
</pre>

Output, when run with commandline parameters as shown:

<pre>
    ./time_machine.rb --username=doc_brown --delorean.roads_needed="" --delorean.power_source="Mr. Fusion"
    {:dest_time=>"11-05-1985", :username=>"doc_brown", :delorean=>{:power_source=>"Mr. Fusion", :roads_needed=>nil}}
</pre>

For an extensive usage in production, see the "wukong gem.":http://github.com/mrflip/wukong

h3. Design goals:

* *Don't go outside the family*. Requires almost no external resources and almost no code in your script.
* *Don't mess with my crew*. Settings for a model over here can be done independently of settings for a model over there, and don't require asking the boss to set something up.
* *Be willing to sit down with the Five Families*. Takes settings from (at your option):
** Pre-defined defaults from constants
** Simple config files
** Environment variables
** Commandline options
** Ruby block called when all other options are in place
* *Code of Silence*. Most commandline parsers force you to pre-define all your parameters in a centralized and wordy syntax. In configliere, you pre-define nothing -- commandline parameters map directly to values in the Configliere hash.
* *Can hide your assets*. Rather than storing passwords and API keys in plain sight, configliere has a protection racket that can obscure values when stored to disk.

h2. Settings structure

A Configliere settings object is just a (mostly-)normal hash.

You can define static defaults in your module

<pre>
    Settings({
      :dest_time => '11-05-1955',
      :fluxcapacitor => {
        :speed => 88,
        },
      :delorean => {
        :power_source => 'plutonium',
        :roads_needed => true,
        },
      :username => 'marty',
      :password => '',
    })
</pre>

All simple keys should be symbols. Don't use strings. Retrieve the settings as:

<pre>
    # hash keys
    Settings[:dest_time]                 #=> '11-05-1955'
    # deep keys
    Settings[:delorean][:power_source]   #=> 'plutonium'
    Settings[:delorean][:missing]        #=> nil
    Settings[:delorean][:missing][:fail] #=> raises an error
    # dotted keys resolve to deep keys
    Settings['delorean.power_source']    #=> 'plutonium'
    Settings['delorean.missing']         #=> nil
    Settings['delorean.missing.fail']    #=> nil
    # method-like (no deep keys tho, and you have to #define the param; see below)
    Settings.dest_time                   #=> '11-05-1955'
</pre>

h3. Only basic functionality loaded by default

Configliere doesn't load any other functionality by default -- you may not want to load config files, or environment variable handling, and so forth.  You can require each file directly, or call @Configliere.use@ with a list of mixins (:all to load all functionality).

<pre>
    Configliere.use :config_file, :define # Load config files and pre-define
    Configliere.use :all                  # all of them
</pre>

h2. Configuration files

Call @Settings.read(filename)@ to read a config file.

<pre>
    # Settings for version II.
    :dest_time:        11-05-2015
    :delorean:
      :power_source:    Mr. Fusion
      :roads_needed:    ~
</pre>

If a bare filename (no '/') is given, configliere looks for the file in @Configliere::DEFAULT_CONFIG_DIR@ (normally ~/.configliere). Otherwise it loads the given file.

<pre>
    Settings.read('/etc/time_machine.yaml')  # looks in /etc/time_machine.yaml
    Settings.read('time_machine.yaml')       # looks in ~/.configliere/time_machine.yaml
</pre>

You can save configuration too:

<pre>
    Settings.save!('/etc/time_machine.yaml') # overwrites /etc/time_machine.yaml
    Settings.save!('time_machine.yaml')      # overwrites ~/.configliere/time_machine.yaml
</pre>

You're free to use as many config files as you like. Loading a config file sets values immediately, so later-loaded files win out over earlier-loaded ones:

<pre>
    Settings.read('time_machine_global.yaml')
    Settings.read('time_machine_site.yaml')
</pre>

h2. Command-line parameters

<pre>
    # Head back
    time_machine --delorean.power_source='1.21 gigawatt lightning strike' --dest_time=11-05-1985
    # (in the time_machine script:)
    Settings.use :commandline
    Settings.resolve!
</pre>

Interpretation of command-line parameters:
* *name-val params*: @--param=val@ sets @Configliere[:param]@ to val. You _must_ use the '=' in there: <code>./my_cmd --filename=bar</code> good, <code>./my_cmd --filename bar</code> bad.
* *boolean params*: @--param@ sets @Configliere[:param]@ to be true. @--param=""@ sets @Configliere[:param]@ to be nil.
* *scoped params*: A dash or dot within a parameter name scopes that parameter: @--group-sub_group-param=val@ sets @Configliere[:group][:subgroup][:param]@ to val (and similarly for boolean parameters). @--group.sub_group.param=val@ and @--group-sub_group-param=val@ do the same thing. 
** Only @[\w\.\-]+@ are accepted in parameter names.
* *Settings.rest*: anything else is stored, in order, in @Settings.rest@.
* *stop marker*: a @--@ alone stops parameter processing and tosses all remaining params (not including the @--@) into Settings.rest.

Here are some things you don't get:
* Apart from converting @''@ (an explicit blank string) to @nil@, no type coercion is performed on parameters unless requested explicitly (see below).
* No validation is performed on parameters.
* No ordering or multiplicity is preserved (you can't say @--file=this --file=that@). If you instead do <code>Settings.define :file, :type => Array</code> you can supply an array or comma-separated list.

Commandline parameters are demonstrated in "examples/simple_script.rb":http://github.com/mrflip/configliere/tree/master/examples/simple_script.rb and "examples/env_var_script.rb":http://github.com/mrflip/configliere/tree/master/examples/env_var_script.rb

h2. Defined Parameters

You don't have to pre-define parameters, but you can:

<pre>
    Settings.use :define
    Settings.define :dest_time, :type => DateTime, :description => 'Arrival time'
    Settings.define 'delorean.power_source', :env_var => 'POWER_SOURCE', :description => 'Delorean subsytem supplying power to the Flux Capacitor.'
    Settings.define :password, :required => true, :encrypted => true
</pre>

* *:type*: converts params to a desired form.
* *:description*: documents a param.
* *:required*: marks params required.
* *:encrypted*: marks params to be obscured when saved to disk. See [#Encrypted Parameters] below for caveats.
* *:env_var*: take param from given environment variable if set.

Defined parameters are demonstrated in most of the "example scripts":http://github.com/mrflip/configliere/tree/master/examples

h3. Type Conversion

<pre>
    Settings.define :dest_time,     :type => DateTime
    Settings.define :fugeddaboudit, :type => Array
    Settings :fugeddaboudit => 'badabing,badaboom,hey', :dest_time => '11-05-1955'
    Settings.resolve!
    Settings[:fugeddaboudit]   #=> ['badabing', 'badaboom', 'hey']
    Settings[:dest_time]       #=> #<DateTime: 4870833/2,0,2299161>
</pre>

Configliere can coerce parameter values to Integer, Float, :boolean, Symbol, Array, Date and DateTime. (Make sure to call Settings.resolve! in your script.)

* :boolean converts nil to nil ; false, 'false', 0, '0' and '' to false; and everything else to true.
* Array just does a simple split on ",". It doesn't do any escaping or quoting.
* Date and DateTime convert unparseable inputs to nil.
* :filename calls File.expand_path() on the argument

h3. Description

If you define a param's description, besides nicely documenting it within your code the description will be stuffed into the output when the --help commandline option is invoked.

h3. Required Parameters

Any required parameter found to be nil raises an error (listing all missing params). (Make sure to call Settings.resolve! in your script.)

h3. Environment Variables

<pre>
    Settings.define :dest_time, :env_var => 'DEST_TIME'
</pre>

Environment variables are demonstrated in "examples/env_var_script.rb":http://github.com/mrflip/configliere/tree/master/examples/env_var_script.rb

h3. Encrypted Parameters

Define a param to be encrypted and invoke Settings.save!

<pre>
   define 'amazon.api.key', :encrypted => true
   Settings 'amazon.api.key' => 'fnord'
</pre>

In this example, the hash saved to disk will contain @{ :amazon => { :api => { :encrypted_key => "...encrypted val..." } } }@. After reading from disk, #resolve! will recover its original value: @{ :amazon => { :api => { :key => "fnord" } } }@. The code currently doesn't look for a collision between a :param and :encrypted_param, so be careful; you can preemptively call resolve_encrypted! to enforce order.

bq.  There are two kinds of cryptography in this world: cryptography that will stop your kid sister from reading your files, and cryptography that will stop major governments from reading your files. This book is about the latter. -- Preface to Applied Cryptography by Bruce Schneier

Configliere provides the former.  Anyone with access to the script, its config files and the config file passphrase can recover the plaintext password. Still, there's a difference between immediate access and having to find a paperclip and jimmy open your annoying older brother's stupid journal.

Encrypted parameters are demonstrated in "examples/encrypted_script.rb":http://github.com/mrflip/configliere/tree/master/examples/encrypted_script.rb

h2. Ruby Block

<pre>
    Settings.finally do |c|
      c.dest_time = (Time.now + 60) if c.username == 'einstein'
      # you can use hash syntax too
      c[:dest_time] = (Time.now + 60) if c[:username] == 'einstein'
    end
    #
    # ... rest of setup ...
    #
    Settings.resolve!    # the finally blocks will be called in order
</pre>

Configliere 'finally' blocks are invoked when you call @#resolve!@.  They're guaranteed to be called at the end of the resolve chain, and before the validate chain.

Config blocks are demonstrated in "examples/config_block.rb":http://github.com/mrflip/configliere/tree/master/examples/config_block.rb

h2. Shortcut syntax for deep keys

You can use a 'dotted key' like 'delorean.power_source' as simple notation for a deep key: @Settings['delorean.power_source']@ is equivalent to @Settings[:delorean][:power_source]@.  You can use a dotted key in any simple reference:

<pre>
  Settings['delorean.power_source'] = "Mr. Fusion"
  Settings[:delorean][:power_source]
  #=> "Mr. Fusion"
  Settings.delete('delorean.power_source')
  #=> "Mr. Fusion"
  Settings
  #=> { :delorean => {} }
</pre>

Intermediate keys "auto-vivify" (automatically create any intervening hashes):

<pre>
  Settings['one.two.three'] = "To tha Fo'"
  # Settings is { :one => { :two => { :three => "To tha Fo'" } }, :delorean => { :power_source => "Mr. Fusion" }
</pre>

Do *not* use a dotted key except as a simple reference. You'll ruin Christmas:

<pre>
  Settings.defaults :this => "that", "made.of.fail" => "oops"
  #=> { :this => "that", :"made.of.fail" => "oops" } # !!! BROKEN !!!
</pre>

h2. Independent Settings

All of the above examples use the global variable @Settings@, defined in configliere.rb.  You're free to define your own settings universe though:

<pre>
    class Wolfman
      attr_accessor :config

      def config
        @config ||= Configliere.new({
          :moon    => full',
          :nards   => true,
          })
      end
    end

    teen_wolf = proj.new
    teen_wolf.config.defaults(:give_me => 'keg of beer')
    teen_wolf.config #=> {:moon=>"full", :nards=>true, :give_me=>"keg of beer" }
    Settings         #=> {}
</pre>

Values in here don't overlap with the Settings object or any other settings universe. However, every one that pulls in commandline params gets a full copy of the commandline params.
