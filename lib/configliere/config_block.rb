  # ConfigBlock lets you use pure ruby to change and define settings.  Call

    #   defined, when the resolve! method is invoked. +config_block+ resolution
    #   is guaranteed to run last in the resolve chain, right before validation.
    #
    # @example
    #   Settings.finally do |c|
    #     c.dest_time = (Time.now + 60) if c.username == 'einstein'
    #     # you can use hash syntax too

    #   end

    #   # after rest of setup:
    #   Settings.resolve!
