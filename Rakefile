   "" So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows. "" -- Don Corleone

Configliere manage settings from many sources: static constants, simple config files, environment variables, commandline options, straight ruby. You don't have to predefine anything, but you can ask configliere to type-convert, require, document or password-obscure any of its fields. Modules can define config settings independently of each other and the main program.
